## What I want to Learn in INFO 201

I want to learn how to use:

- the command line
- github
- data to create cool visualizations

I don't know much of anything about these technical aspects *now*, but I am hoping that that will change as the quarter progresses. I am also excited to use an **IDE** because I used one when I learned Java and it made coding much easier and more fun.
